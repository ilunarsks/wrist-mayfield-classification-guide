# Case Study Template – Mayfield Classification

Use this template to create a structured case study for a specific stage of carpal instability according to the Mayfield classification. Ensure all sections are completed with appropriate detail and evidence‑based reasoning.

---

## **Patient Presentation**
- Age, gender, hand dominance
- Chief complaint and duration of symptoms
- Mechanism of injury (e.g., fall on outstretched hand, high‑energy trauma)
- Relevant past medical history (previous wrist injuries, systemic conditions)

## **Physical Examination Findings**
- Inspection (swelling, ecchymosis, deformity)
- Palpation (areas of maximal tenderness, crepitus)
- Range of motion (active/passive flexion‑extension, radial/ulnar deviation)
- Special tests (scaphoid shift test, Watson test, lunotriquetral ballottement, midcarpal shift)
- Neurovascular status (median, ulnar, radial nerve function; capillary refill)

## **Imaging Findings**
### **Plain Radiographs (X‑rays)**
- Describe the standard views obtained (PA, lateral, oblique, clenched‑fist)
- Key observations:
  - Scapholunate interval (Terry‑Thomas sign)
  - Gilula arcs (disruption, step‑off)
  - Radiolunate angle, capitolunate angle
  - Position of the lunate (volar/dorsal tilt, dislocation)
  - Associated fractures (scaphoid, radial styloid, triquetrum)

### **Advanced Imaging (if performed)**
- CT: detail of bony anatomy, occult fractures, alignment
- MRI: evaluation of intrinsic/extrinsic ligaments, triangular fibrocartilage complex, cartilage
- Ultrasound: dynamic assessment of ligamentous integrity

## **Diagnosis**
- Primary diagnosis (e.g., “Mayfield Stage I – Scapholunate Dissociation”)
- Differential diagnoses considered
- Rationale for the chosen diagnosis based on history, exam, and imaging

## **Proposed Treatment Plan**
### **Non‑surgical Management**
- Indications (acute vs. chronic, stability, patient factors)
- Immobilization (type of splint/cast, duration)
- Rehabilitation protocol (timeline for motion, strengthening, return to activity)

### **Surgical Management**
- Indications for surgery (failed conservative treatment, persistent instability, associated fractures)
- Surgical options (arthroscopic vs. open repair, ligament reconstruction, capsulodesis, fusion)
- Post‑operative protocol (immobilization, therapy, expected outcomes)

## **Key Learning Points**
- 3–5 bullet points summarizing the most important clinical pearls for this stage
- Common pitfalls in diagnosis or management
- Red flags that warrant urgent referral or advanced imaging
