# Wrist Mayfield Classification Educational Guide

## Purpose
This repository serves as a collaborative educational resource for medical students, junior residents, and healthcare professionals seeking to deepen their understanding of carpal injuries, particularly those classified by the Mayfield system. The goal is to provide structured, peer-reviewed case studies that illustrate the diagnosis, imaging findings, and management principles for each stage of carpal instability.

## Target Audience
- Medical students rotating in orthopedics, emergency medicine, or sports medicine
- Junior orthopedic, emergency, and primary care residents
- Physical therapists and occupational therapists working with hand and wrist injuries
- Any clinician interested in refining their approach to wrist trauma

## Overview of Mayfield Classification
The Mayfield classification describes a progressive sequence of ligamentous and carpal disruptions caused by wrist hyperextension, ulnar deviation, and intercarpal supination. It is widely used to understand perilunate instability patterns and guide treatment decisions.

### Stages:
1. **Stage I – Scapholunate Dissociation**  
   Disruption of the scapholunate interosseous ligament, leading to a widened scapholunate interval (>3 mm) on anteroposterior radiographs (Terry‑Thomas sign).

2. **Stage II – Perilunate Dislocation**  
   Progression of the injury through the midcarpal joint, resulting in dislocation of the capitate from the lunate while the lunate remains normally aligned with the radius.

3. **Stage III – Triquetrolunate Dissociation**  
   Further propagation through the lunotriquetral ligament, causing disruption between the lunate and triquetrum.

4. **Stage IV – Lunate Dislocation**  
   Complete disruption of the dorsal radiocarpal ligaments, allowing the lunate to displace volarly (most commonly) into the carpal tunnel, often associated with median nerve symptoms.

## Repository Structure
- `CASE_STUDY_TEMPLATE.md` – Template for consistent case‑study contributions.

- `references/` – Key literature and further reading.

## How to Contribute
1. Review the case‑study template.
2. Choose an open issue corresponding to a Mayfield stage.
3. Fork the repository, create a new branch, and draft your case study.
4. Submit a pull request for expert review.
