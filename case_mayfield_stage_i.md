# Case Study – Mayfield Stage I: Scapholunate Dissociation

## Patient Presentation
- 24‑year‑old male, right‑hand‑dominant collegiate basketball player
- Fell on an outstretched left hand during a game, immediate dorsal wrist pain and swelling
- Presents 2 days post‑injury with persistent pain, especially with gripping
- No prior wrist injuries; otherwise healthy

## Physical Examination Findings
- Inspection: moderate dorsal swelling, no obvious deformity
- Palpation: maximal tenderness over the anatomic snuffbox (scaphoid) and dorsally just distal to Lister’s tubercle
- Range of motion: limited to 30° extension, 40° flexion (compared to 70°/80° on contralateral side)
- Special tests: Watson (scaphoid shift) test is positive – painful clunk with dorsal pressure on scaphoid tubercle while moving wrist from ulnar to radial deviation
- Neurovascular: intact median, ulnar, and radial nerve function; capillary refill <2 seconds

## Imaging Findings
### Plain Radiographs (X‑rays)
- PA view: **widened scapholunate interval of 5 mm (Terry‑Thomas sign)**; the scapholunate angle is increased (>60°), consistent with dorsal intercalated segment instability (DISI)
- Lateral view: **the lunate appears dorsally tilted (extension)**, confirming the DISI pattern
- Clenched‑fist view: further widening of the scapholunate gap, confirming ligamentous insufficiency

### Advanced Imaging
- MRI obtained: confirms complete tear of the scapholunate interosseous ligament, with partial involvement of the dorsal intercarpal ligament. No associated fracture.

## Diagnosis
- **Primary diagnosis:** Mayfield Stage I – Scapholunate dissociation with dorsal intercalated segment instability (DISI)
- **Differential diagnoses:** scaphoid fracture, distal radius fracture, lunotriquetral instability
- **Rationale:** history of FOOSH, positive Watson test, radiographic widening >3 mm, MRI confirmation of ligament tear

## Proposed Treatment Plan
### Non‑surgical Management
- Indications: acute injury (<6 weeks), reducible alignment on imaging, patient desires non‑operative approach
- Immobilization: **short arm cast or wrist splint for 4–6 weeks** (thumb spica is not required unless there is concomitant scaphoid injury)
- Rehabilitation: after cast removal, gradual range‑of‑motion exercises, then strengthening at 8–10 weeks

### Surgical Management
- Indications: failure of conservative treatment, chronic instability, associated fractures
- Surgical options: **open or arthroscopic reduction, direct repair of the scapholunate ligament, and temporary K‑wire fixation** (often supplemented with dorsal capsulodesis or ligament reconstruction in chronic cases)
- Post‑operative protocol: cast immobilization for 6–8 weeks, wire removal at 6–8 weeks, followed by progressive therapy

## Key Learning Points
- The Terry‑Thomas sign (>3 mm scapholunate gap on PA radiograph) is pathognomonic for scapholunate dissociation.
- In dorsal intercalated segment instability (DISI), the scapholunate angle is increased (>60°) and the lunate tilts dorsally on the lateral view.
- For acute, reducible injuries without fracture, immobilization with a short arm cast or wrist splint (without thumb spica) for 4–6 weeks is appropriate.
- Surgical treatment should aim to restore ligament integrity; K‑wires alone are insufficient – direct ligament repair or reconstruction is required for long‑term stability.
